    <h1>Tickets</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>Do I have to get a ticket for each event? </dt>
      <dd>Yes. We decided to keep the tickets separate so we can estimate the attendance for each event better.</dd>
      <dt>I lost my ticket. Help! </dt>
      <dd>Don't panic! First of all, the ticket should be in your email inbox. If you actually deleted the email, then you can email us at lost@projectcel.com and we will send you an email with your ticket.</dd>
      <dt>How can I cancel my ticket?</dt>
      <dd>If you have a ticket to one of the free events then visit http://bit.ly/1amBn4T to cancel it. If you wish to cancel your Insights ticket then visit http://bit.ly/15vl2HM or email us at sales@projectcel and we'll do it for you.</dd>

    <h1>Travel</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>Why are the events split in between Nicosia and Limassol?</dt>
      <dd>Nicosia doesn't have much to offer in terms of beaches so the opening beach party will happen in Limassol. The rest of the events are happening in Nicosia because of the kind support of the University of Cyprus and the excellent infrastructure provided by the Hilton Park hotel.</dd>
      <dt>Will you be providing transport between the two cities?  </dt>
      <dd>[topic for discussion, maybe put up later]</dd>

    <h1>Insights</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>Why are you charging money for Insights?</dt>
      <dd>Insights is a really big event and it's impossible to cover it with sponsorship money. We're flying speakers in, arranging accommodation, providing breakfast and lunch for you and a couple of hundred other people – it quickly adds up to a lot. Looking at other conferences in Europe right now and judging by the caliber of our speakers and workshops, we feel that the ticket price is quite fair.</dd>
      <dt>What will I learn about? </dt>
      <dd>You'll learn both about how to start and how to scale. You'll learn how to listen only to what's relevant to you, how to convince people that your team is the right one for them and how to raise money in times of crisis. Other topics will include design & product, hardware, running your startup on metrics and more. Our guests have many years of startup experience, founded many companies and have attended some of the most prestigious startup accelerators in the world. Yes, you'll be in very good hands. Enjoy.</dd>

      <dt>Do I need to have team to participate?</dt>
      <dd>No, you can come with a team or you can find a team on the day. We will encourage everyone to pitch their idea so you can get a spherical view of all the projects and – why not? – join one of them.</dd>
      <dt>Do I have to stay up all night?</dt>
      <dd>No, you don't have to. But be cool and do.</dd>
