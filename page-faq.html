    <dl>
      <dt>What is the Cypriot Enterprise Link?</dt>
      <dd>The Cypriot Enterprise Link (CEL) is a youth-led organization aimed to connect and support the Cypriot entrepreneurial talent in order to form a local and a global entrepreneurial network supported by events, meetups, workshops and projects. For more information visit <a href="http://projectcel.com" target="_blank">http://projectcel.com</a> and our Facebook page at <a href="http://facebook.com/CypriotEnterpriseLink" target="_blank">http://facebook.com/CypriotEnterpriseLink</a>.</dd>
      <dt>Are you making money out of this?</dt>
      <dd>No, we are not. The money we charge for Insights tickets go towards venue and food expenses. The rest of the events are free anyway, and they are made possible because of our lovely sponsors.</dd>
      <dt>This seems interesting, how can I be involved?</dt>
      <dd>We always need an extra hand of help, so thank you for wanting to get involved. Please visit <a href="http://projectcel.com/us/volunteer" target="_blank">http://projectcel.com/us/volunteer</a> for more information.</dd>

    <h1>Tickets</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>Do I have to get a ticket for each event? </dt>
      <dd>Yes. We decided to keep the tickets separate so we can estimate the attendance for each event better.</dd>
      <dt>I lost my ticket. Help! </dt>
      <dd>Don't panic! First of all, the ticket should be in your email inbox. If you actually deleted the email, then you can email us at <a href="mailto:lost@projectcel.com" target="_blank">lost@projectcel.com</a> and we will send you an email with your ticket.</dd>
      <dt>How can I cancel my ticket?</dt>
      <dd>If you have a ticket to one of the free events then visit <a href="http://bit.ly/1amBn4T" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1amBn4T</a> to cancel it. If you wish to cancel your Insights ticket then visit <a href="http://bit.ly/15vl2HM" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/15vl2HM</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:sales@projectcel.com" target="_blank">sales@projectcel.com</a> and we'll do it for you.</dd>

    <h1>Travel</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>Why are the events split in between Nicosia and Limassol?</dt>
      <dd>Nicosia doesn't have much to offer in terms of beaches so the opening beach party will happen in Limassol. The rest of the events are happening in Nicosia because of the kind support of the University of Cyprus and the excellent infrastructure provided by the Hilton Park hotel.</dd>

    <h1>Insights</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>Why are you charging money for Insights?</dt>
      <dd>Insights is a really big event and it's impossible to cover it with sponsorship money. We're flying speakers in, arranging accommodation, providing breakfast and lunch for you and a couple of hundred other people – it quickly adds up to a lot. Looking at other conferences in Europe right now and judging by the caliber of our speakers and workshops, we feel that the ticket price is quite fair.</dd>
      <dt>What will I learn about? </dt>
      <dd>You'll learn both about how to start and how to scale. You'll learn how to listen only to what's relevant to you, how to convince people that your team is the right one for them and how to raise money in times of crisis. Other topics will include design &amp; product, hardware, running your startup on metrics and more. Our guests have many years of startup experience, founded many companies and have attended some of the most prestigious startup accelerators in the world. All in all, you'll be in very good hands. Enjoy!</dd>
      <dt>Does my ticket include lunch?</dt>
      <dd>Yes, it does. The hotel's chefs will prepare lunch for all attendees at no extra cost.</dd>

    <dl>
      <dt>Do I need to have team to participate?</dt>
      <dd>No, you can come with a team or you can find a team on the day. We will encourage everyone to pitch their idea so you can get a spherical view of all the projects and – why not? – join one of them.</dd>
      <dt>Do I have to stay up all night?</dt>
      <dd>No, you don't have to. But be cool and do.</dd>
