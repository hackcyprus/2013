        <h1>Andy Young</h1>
        <p>Andy graduated from Oxford University where he was the VP of Oxford Entrepreneurs. He then founded GroupSpaces, one of the leading startups in the London tech scene and raised capital from Index Ventures. On the side, he grew his app Selective Tweets to 1 million users. All this by the age of 26. He is now an integral part in Stripe's mission to reinvent online payments.</p>
        <p>Andy will take the stage at The Insights Conference and talk about <b>"How not to drown in startup advice"</b> – a topic absolutely vital to any Cypriot entrepreneur. The startup world is full of "advice" – blogs, tweets, speakers etc – which ends up being more confusing than clarifying. Andy uses his 8 years in startups to explore how to sensibly navigate this information and draw useful, tangible conclusions to drive yourself forward.</p>
